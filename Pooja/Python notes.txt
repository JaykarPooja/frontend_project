Unicode:- Universal Character Encoding Standard.

list will store mem location(address) in ordered list not actual value (imp-hence that data used as a object)
ordered/unmutable - which can't be changable [1,2,3,5,6]
mutable- which can be changable can add diff data types data[1,2,3,apple]
duplicates-[1,2,2,5,6]
list is nothing but an array but it has dynamic memory u can add or removed new data
but array has fixed size & fixed memory



list methods
append()  adds 1 new object at the end of list - append(object)
insert()  insert value at given position or index, next all values will shift forwards - insert(pos/index, object)
extend()  adds more new objects at the end of list - its not necessary that it is list or tupples
